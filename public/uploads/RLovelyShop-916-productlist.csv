PRODUCT INFORMATION:
Hairband - Ponytail Chignon
The chain made of high quality acrylic is a plug-in system. This allows you to separate or interlock the chain links and adjust them exactly to your desired length. The standard hair band is attached to the snap rings, which are available in silver, gold and metal gun. This makes the &quot;HAIRCHAIN&quot; elastic and therefore comfortable. If you want to put the chain around your high ponytail, chignon or chignon, shorten the chain and put the ends directly into each other without the snap ring.

When you don&#39;t need the chain for your hair, wear it as a necklace, bracelet or short handle for your bag. Tada! A chain for all occasions!
